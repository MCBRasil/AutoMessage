### AutoMessage for Glydar.
AutoMessage is the third plugin EVER developed for Glydar and currently give you the ability to write custom automated messages from the console to the players chat (Actually not yet since chat packets haven't been implemented.)

Here you can see the config file:
```
#-------------------------#
# AutoMessage config file #
#    By: Puharesource     #
#-------------------------#

prefix: 'AutoMessage> '
interval: 60
write-to-console: true
testmessage: 
    - 'This is a test message'
    - 'This is another test message'
    - 'This is a third test message'
```

### Updates
I'll try to keep on updating this plugin for as long as Glydar exists, ofc if something comes up I might not be able to but, atm I'll be updating it all the time.
